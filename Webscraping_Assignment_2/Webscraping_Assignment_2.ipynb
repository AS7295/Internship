       " 'The upcoming Aston Martin hybrid hypercar hasn’t even hit the market yet, but already the $3.2 million Valkyrie has sold out. For what it’s worth, Aston Martin hasn’t officially released pricing. Estimates suggest the hypercar could go for anywhere between $2.6 and $3.9 million – but $3.2 million seems to be the magic number. Whatever the case, this machine is impressive. Its Cosworth-sourced 6.5-liter V12 produces 1,160 horsepower (865 kilowatts) and 664 pound-feet (900 Newton-meters) of torque, meaning its top speed should be well over 200 miles per hour (321 kilometers per hour). The company will build just 150 examples of the standard Valkyrie, with a limited 25-run AMR model arriving later.',\n",

Somewhat surprisingly, Pagani gave the roadster 50 more horsepower than its coupe sibling, by cranking up its AMG-sourced twin-turbocharged 6.0-liter V12.
